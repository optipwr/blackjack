Example of the Deal button

```javascript
$('.deal-button').click(function(){
	if(betValue == 0){
		// Do nothing!
	}
	else{
		// Disables Deal button after hand is dealt
		$('.deal-button').attr('disabled', true);
		// Animation for cards being dealt
		$('.card-move-1').css('animation', 'card-move-1 1s');
		$('.card-move-2').css('animation', 'card-move-2 1s');
		shuffleDeck();
		// Use shift to remove the top card from the deck as card goes to either player or dealer
		playersHand.push(theDeck.shift());
		dealersHand.push(theDeck.shift());
		playersHand.push(theDeck.shift());
		dealersHand.push(theDeck.shift()); //Pushes the dealer's second card value

		placeCard('player', 1, playersHand[0]);
		placeCard('player', 2, playersHand[1]);
		placeCard('dealer', 1, dealersHand[0]);
		placeCard('dealer', 2, 'deck'); //Dealer's second card showing only the card back.

		calculateTotal(playersHand, 'player'); //Checking win condition on initial deal
		calculateTotal(dealersHand, 'dealer');
		hitCounter++;
		hasDealt = true;
		if(calculateTotal(playersHand, 'player') === 21){
			placeCard('dealer', 2, dealersHand[1]); //Will reveal the second initial card the dealer got to show you how dealer won
			checkWin();
		}
	}
});
```

Creating the Deck

```javascript
function createDeck(){
	var newDeck = [];
	var suits = ['h', 's', 'd', 'c'];
	for(let s = 0; s < suits.length; s++){
		for(let c = 1; c <= 13; c++){
			newDeck.push(c + suits[s]);
		}
	}
	return newDeck;
}
```
